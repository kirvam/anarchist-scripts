Ray likes the idea of owning it.  Peter does not.  ACLs on the core really makes the most sense for the big, fat pipes. I do like the idea of removing our physical mgmt firewalls from the mix and it is something that should be a lot easier and less disruptive after migration to VxRack is complete.; Green
